  Josh Rodriguez's 100 Days Of Code Log
</h1>

### Day 1: March 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my personal portfolio today. While building the work/project section, I got to explore and use the new Gatsby v3 image plugin.

**Thoughts**: Lately, I'm feeling pressured to build a ton of projects so I can hurry up and add them to my portfolio and start applying for jobs, but I need to remind myself not to overthink this and just stay focused on the controllables.

### Day 2: March 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Confession, I did not code/work on any projects today. Instead, I did some self learning.

**Thoughts**: I spent my day self learning, watching and coding along a frontend masters next.js tutorial and reading up on ui/design systems. Tomorrow, I'll get back to working on my portfolio & starting a new project I had an idea for.
