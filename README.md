### Day 1: March 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my personal portfolio today. While building the work/project section, I got to explore and use the new Gatsby v3 image plugin.

**Thoughts**: Lately, I'm feeling pressured to build a ton of projects so I can hurry up and add them to my portfolio and start applying for jobs, but I need to remind myself not to overthink this and just stay focused on the controllables.
